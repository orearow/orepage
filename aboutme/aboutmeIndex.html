	<h3>Calgary, AB</h3>
	<p>Although my family is originally from Nigeria (which explains my name) I have lived in Calgary for about twenty years</p>
	<p>Some of my favorite things about the city I live are the wonderful people, and I am so thankful to live here! </p>
	<p>I spend some of my time walking along Steven Ave, at Studio Bell and the Glenbow Museum, and some of the interesting art events around the city. </p>
