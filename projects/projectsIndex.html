	<font color="white"><p> In this project I created a visualization of data from the website Goodreads using html, javascript, and a javascript library called 
            d3.js. All of the data in this visualization is found using the goodreads API. 
        </p>

<p> The primary goal of this visualization answers the question <b>How can we visualize the way that two books are similar to each other?</b>, and if you are really interested you can read about more 
    of the details in this <a href="http://ricelab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/papers/ore2017goodreads/"> research paper </a>, or look at the <a href="https://github.com/orearow/BookBubbles"> source code </a> for yourself on my github.

       <h3>Summary</h3>

	<p> This app was created in my HCI class (human computer interactions)with the help of two other people. We created this app using android studi, and our overall goal 
          was to help women moniter and track their periods. The app consists of a calender, where users can select the days they recieved their period, and the app 
          creates a window period that outlines when next the user will have their period.Users are also able to keep track of symptoms such as crams, their mood, and level of activity  .

                                                <br>
	<p> This is a website that I created along with three other team members. In order to create superfan, my team and I used Html, css, php, and sql. Much like IMDB, superfan is a website where fans are able 
            to sign up and look up details about their favorite movies and tv shows. Some of these details may include actors, directors, studios and more. Administrators can also add and remove or edit movies/ tv shows as well.
        </p> <p> This project holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the world of databases.</p>

	<font color="white"><p> This is a web app that I created with a team of four during the synopsis 2017 hackathon. We had 42 hours to complete a project under the theme "optimization and automation" and Lazy fridge is what we came up with. </P>
	<p> The idea behind lazy fridge is to automate the task of figuring out what to cook with the ingredients that you have available to you in your fridge. To make this as easy as possible, our goal was to have users
	    take pictures of the contents of their fridge and recieve a list of recipies as an output. Do to time constraints we did not implement a camera function, but  users can upload a link to a photo and still recieve 
	    recipies. This app was created using html, javascript, and lots of help from the microsoft cognative api and the fork to spoon api.
