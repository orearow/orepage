        <p>Sketch, design, implement and document via a web portfolio a software application where the
            central interaction is with a button, such that the interaction represents some aspect of you
            clientâ€™s personality or character.
            Yep, a singular button. You define: the context of the button, what that button does, and the 'aesthetic' of
            the button. All of the interaction surrounding that one button.
            Your client for this project can be a class member, a celebrity, or a fictional character.
            Note: the client you choose should either be someone most people in the class should know or be
            someone in the class itself. <p>

        <p>Overall our group was very communicative throughout the entire process. The original idea of "a day in the life of trunp"
        was a result of one of my original sketches. And it was interesting to see how that idea evolved through our itteration of sketches.
        For example, eventually we decided to drop the "morning" to "evening" to "night" aspects of the button and instead decided to opt for simple schenes that
        showcased what trump might be up to at any given moments. Eventually at the end of the day we decided to make all of these day
        in the life scenes interactive. So then we could combine some of the ideas from our original sketches. (Tweets, wall building etc)
            with our current main idea.</p>

        <p>For the actual project itself I helped to find images to use for our different scenes. We also went through
        several iterations of buttons before we got to the "maga hat" button. Before that the buttons that I found were a trump face
            and a make america great again button.</p>

        <p>Coding wise I helped with animations such as the trip adviser animation, the wll animation. the miss america text
        animation and a few other animations that eventually we decided to cut out of our final project like a
        closed for bankruptcy animation and a tipping wine glass animation. <p>
