	<h1>P0</h1>
<p>Sketch, design, implement and document via a web portfolio a software application where the
central interaction is with a button, such that the interaction represents some aspect of you
clientâ€™s personality or character.
Yep, a singular button. You define: the context of the button, what that button does, and the 'aesthetic' of
the button. All of the interaction surrounding that one button.
Your client for this project can be a class member, a celebrity, or a fictional character.
Note: the client you choose should either be someone most people in the class should know or be
someone in the class itself. <p>

	<h3>Calgary, AB</h3>
	<p>Although my family is originally from Nigeria (which explains my name) I have lived in Calgary for more than seventeen years</p>

	<h1>The stuff I find cool</h1>
	<h4>I like random did you know facts. (Did you know 85% of plant life is found in the ocean)</h4>
	<p>I have been playing piano since I was seven. So piano is pretty cool- yeah. </p>
        <p>Books books and more books. I am a cookie-cutter case book worm. I also like poetry and prose!</p>
        <p>Snowboarding, squash, the field part of track and field.</p>


	<h4>what interests me in comp sci?</h4>
	<p> Other than creating a super-bot that is able to cook for me/ take over the world, I am very interested in HCI</p>
        <p>HCI is short for human computer interactions and is my concentration in the university of calgary.  </p>
        <p>I also find studies on brain to computer interfaces too cool to handle. Also, autonimous robots! And digital humanities.   </p>
        <p>Another dream of mine is to use my skills in computer science to held the developing world.    </p>
        <p>But honestly I am a little interested in everything.  </p>
